# Module - Integrationtests
This module is used to run a integrationtest on the project. What this means is that in order to test the project as a whole, not every module indevidually, we need a new test. The test makes sure that a server is running before launching the app and that it closes afterwards. This checks wether or not the app works while the server is running.
