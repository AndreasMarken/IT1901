# Userstories

Most of us have used software apps that were both enjoyable and easy to use. Most of us have probably experienced quite the opposite aswell. What is it that "makes or breaks" an app?

To develop a great software app, we have to create a product that matches the users mental model for how it is supposed to work. 

To achive this, we have to make ends meet between the conceptual model of our product, and the users conceptual model.

### Description

Live works as a doctor at the St. Olavs hospital. Her days are usually quite busy. When she is not working, she loves spending quality time with her husband and two young children. They often watch a movie together. If it is a good movie, Live would like to recommend it for her friends, her colleagues and her patients. In Lives opinion, movies are always a great subject to talk about, to get the conversation going. When talking about movies with others, she also often recive recommendations. Sadly, due to busy days of work, she forgets the movie she was recomended.
