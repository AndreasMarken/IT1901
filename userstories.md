# Conceptual model

## Concepts

### Design metaphor
- A Movie-object has a rectangular shape, just like a movie poster, with its attributes displayed on the front of this "poster" similar to a typical movie poster layout. 


### Data-objects 
- Movie-objects that can be initiated and deleted
- A "database" list-object which contains all Movie-objects that the user initiates
- A "watchlist" list-object which is a sublist of the "database" list-object, in which the user can add and remove Movie-objects

### Data-object attributes and operations

#### Movie-object attributes
- Title
- Release date
- Duration
- Rating (1, 1.1, 1.2, ..., 10)

#### Movie-object operations
- set and edit the title
- set and edit the release date
- set and edit the duration
- set and edit the rating
 
#### List-object attributes
- A list consisting of Movie-objects, initially zero

#### List-object operations
- Sort the Movie-objects contained in the list based on rating, title and duration
- Add Movie-objects
- Remove Movie-objects

### Relations
- The "database" list-object contains all the Movie-objects initiated by the user
- The "watchlist" list-object is a sublist of the "database" list-object
- The Movie-object has a title, release date, duration and rating

### Mapping
- The list-objects corresponds to a library of movies
- A Movie-object corresponds to an existing movie that the user has added some details to
