As a user of MMT i would like to add different types of movies to a list.

The user will easily be able to add movies to the list of movies, also known as the database. When adding movies to the data base, the user will be able to set title, release date and duration of the movie. The current information stored on the database will always be possible to se in the frontpage. The frontpage will update as soon as a new movie is added to the database.
